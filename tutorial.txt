how to run:
if code edited
docker-compose up --build 
if not
docker-compose up 

Problem:

X person is a new developer for a project. To prepare the development environment, he/she needs to
configure multiple dependencies and technologies for project. Configuring these projects and dependencies 
are a problem locally.

Solution:

Our project contains Redis and Node.js (multiple technologies and dependecies). To sustain maintainability of the dependencies, 
packages and also addition of new technologies on the project in future, Docker helps us to run the application without configuring
these dependencies and technologies locally for each team member during development.
